# Neil Sinha — Platform + AI Engineering Portfolio

🔗 **Live site:** [neil.webfoundryprivatelimited.com](https://neil.webfoundryprivatelimited.com)

A premium, scroll-driven engineering portfolio built with Astro, deployed on Cloudflare Pages — and governed by the same engineering discipline I apply to production systems.

## What makes this repo different

This isn't just a portfolio website. It's a demonstration of **governed AI-assisted development** using OpenClaw — an agentic AI engineering operating system.

Every change to this site was planned, prompted, reviewed, and shipped using:
- Issue-first workflow with proof-bundle delivery
- Playbook-routed execution by domain
- CI quality gates and merge discipline
- Human review at every decision point

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Astro 5 (static output)
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages
- **Design:** Dark-mode SPA with scroll-driven narrative
- **Governance:** OpenClaw playbooks + proof-bundle discipline

## Repository layout

## OpenClaw Governance Framework

This repo follows a lightweight, evidence-first governance model so AI-assisted changes stay safe, reviewable, and reproducible.

### Governance principles
- **Issue-first delivery:** every meaningful change starts from a tracked issue.
- **Playbook-routed execution:** implementation follows domain playbooks before code changes.
- **Proof-bundle completion:** each PR includes validation evidence, risk notes, and rollback intent.
- **Merge discipline:** no direct merges; required checks and review gates must pass first.

### Core principles
- **Traceability:** issue ↔ PR ↔ commit ↔ validation artifacts are always linked.
- **Small, auditable changes:** prefer narrow PRs over broad refactors.
- **Safety by default:** call out security/data impact even for docs and infra updates.
- **Operational readiness:** release and monitoring posture are part of done, not afterthoughts.

### Getting started
1. Open or select a scoped issue with clear acceptance criteria.
2. Confirm area label and route through the relevant playbook in `docs/playbooks/`.
3. Implement in a focused branch with evidence-backed PR description sections.
4. Run required validation locally/CI and post proof artifacts on the linked issue.
5. Merge only after checks are green and governance gates are satisfied.
